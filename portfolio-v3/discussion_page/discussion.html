    <h1>What is Art of Web? </h1>
    <h2>It was more than just an html/css/js class. It taught us the importance of accessible design,
        the issues with the web, and the dangers of websites. It taught us how to be </h2>

    <p id="text">Main takeaway: Mail art is a non-traditional understanding of art media. Although "the mail" is suggesting that it is connected with the postal system, Mail Art is about the art itself while the postal system is its support. The author suggests that Mail Art is more than just making postcards, it emphasizes the importance of the postal system for the artist. Discussion Questions: 
        1. The author talks about the "Big Monster" in relation to the postal system. What does this Monster symbolize in Mail Art/ how does the limitations and rules around the postal system affect the way artists create and share their work? 
        
        2. If the postal system is the support for Mail Art, not the main tool, what other types of art are there where their support structure is also important?This essay calls for individuals, especially artists, to reclaim the web from corporate dominance and contribute to its evolution. With the metaphors, I can see how websites are living, temporal spaces with the power to shape identities/ideas and is a collective endeavor. However, I don't think we will ever be able to break free from corporate reign on the internet. To be in charge of a large company, you have to be selected. If you're selected that means you abide by the core principals of the company that are already established, which usually involve continuing to develop the app, site, or state of the internet in a way that can make the company more money. Therefore, can we really evoke change? 

        Discussion Questions:
        
        The essay highlights the importance of individual contributions to shaping the web's future. How do you see artists and creators influencing the web landscape, and what unique perspectives or experiences do they bring to this digital realm?
        
        The author presents various metaphors for a website, such as a room, shelf, plant, or puddle. Which metaphor resonates with you the most, and how does it reflect your perception of websites? Can you think of other metaphors that capture the essence of a website for you personally? The article delves into the history of Geocities, a free web hosting service that played a crucial role in the early days of personal websites. Geocities became a vibrant space for users to express themselves through web design. However, with the advent of social media and changing design trends, Geocities eventually lost its popularity and was shut down by Yahoo! 

        1.  How do you think the nostalgic elements of Geocities, such as themed neighborhoods and bordered backgrounds, contributed to the unique culture of early web design? Can you think of any modern trends or platforms that carry a similar nostalgic sentiment?
        
        2. Geocities' shutdown sparked efforts to archive its content, allowing researchers to explore the early web. Considering the potential loss of digital history, do you believe it's crucial to preserve early web content? In my current job, I work for an e-commerce beauty brand, where we have to ensure alt text is on every image. At first glance, it can be seen as a mundane task, but after reading "Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry," I realized that writing alt-text can inherently change your perception of the brand and site. Therefore, adding alt-text is beneficial not just to the user but also to the business, which is more reason to convince companies to focus more heavily on alt-text. We are not just writing alt text for the sole purpose of abiding by legal matters but also creating an experience that is accessible for everyone.  
        The article explores the challenges of decolonizing digital spaces, focusing on the representation of non-Latin scripts in programming languages and the dominance of English in the programming world. The author introduces the non-English programming language as an attempt to challenge linguistic biases in software development. Despite its efforts, the article emphasizes the inherent limitations faced by non-English programming initiatives within the predominantly English-centric programming landscape, raising questions about the future of programming languages and the need for a more inclusive approach.

Discussion questions: 

1. How can the programming community address linguistic biases and create an environment that accommodates diverse languages? 2. What steps can be taken to encourage collaboration and communication across linguistic boundaries in the development of programming languages and tools? I found the "Feeding Each Other The Feeds" section of the reading particularly interesting. The concept of having a 'God-Like' view of the world through surveillance is oddly captivating. I recall how, even at home, my parents take pleasure in receiving notifications from our ring doorbell when a mailman delivers a package, as they watch from inside. Feeds on social media also offer this 'God-Like' view, allowing us to observe and monitor others and pass judgment. This has shifted my perspective on social media, as it's not just about providing us with dopamine, but also about making us feel superior to some extent.

1. How do you think social media and feeds have evolved over the years? Do you think they have become more or less community-oriented?
2. How often do you find yourself surveilling others? For example, using "Find my Friends," Instagram, or even Spotify!
